I am a 0-year Master candidate in Computer Science at XXX. I am grateful to be advised by XXX.

I am broadly interested in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. My long-term goal is to build **robust, controllable, accountable, and responsible large language models**. My recent work focuses on enhancing safety alignment of LLMs and VLMs.
